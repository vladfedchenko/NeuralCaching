\section{Conclusions}

In the report, we have explored the topic of application of machine learning algorithms for caching purposes. We have reviewed the work done in the field, including recently proposed approaches for constructing a caching policy, established solutions and industry-leading policies. We continued by discussing the data which is required to conduct experiments and moved to a discussion of the applicability of feedforward neural networks for object popularity prediction. We proposed an architecture of a neural network which is suitable for this task. Based on the proposed architecture of the neural network we introduced a new caching policy. We evaluated the performance of the proposed caching policy on real-world data using the cache hit rate metric and achieved the performance beter than classic caching policies.  Then we discussed the optimal ways to configure the proposed policy and designed a rule of thumb for easy policy tuning. We continued by proposing further development of the policy and finished with a comparison of our approach with another machine learning-based solution. Our policy showed better performance in all tests.

Overall, the proposed solution improves over established policies and based on the performance shown can be considered as worthy to be further studied and developed.
