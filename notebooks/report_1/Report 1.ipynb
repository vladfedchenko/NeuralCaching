    "After examination of the source code a bug has been discovered that caused the trouble with the evaluation of the distance to distribution. After the bug has been fixed it was decided to test different neural network configurations:\n",
    "* do not apply sigmoid activation to any layer;\n",
    "* apply sigmoid activation only to hidden layers;\n",
    "* apply sigmoid activation to all layers;\n",
    "\n",
    "Each configuration has 2 hidden layers with 20 neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests has been performed on 3 different types of datasets which were produced using generated traces with 2 types of population. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Case 1: single population.__<br>\n",
    "Arrivals: Poisson with 20.0 mean time between arrivals.<br>\n",
    "Popularity: Zipf with 0.8 parameter.<br>\n",
    "Number of items: 100 000.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Case 2: mixed 2 populations.__<br>\n",
    "Arrivals: Poisson with 40.0 mean time between arrivals for both of populations.<br>\n",
    "Popularity: Zipf with 0.8 parameter for both populations, but for second population the IDs are randomly shuffled each time window.<br>\n",
    "Number of items: 50 000 in each population.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Dataset 1** is generated using only case 1 population, the **Dataset 2** - using case 2 population without keeping class label, the **Dataset 3** - using case 2 population keeping class label. Each dataset consists of 6 columns - ID of the object, popularities in 4 previous time windows, popularity in 5-th time window (which NN should try to predict). **Dataset 3** additionally contains a column with class label (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "During tests it was observed that the neural network performs better training on **Dataset 2** rather than on **Dataset 3**, which should't be the case, since **Dataset 3** contains more information. It was decided to transform **Dataset 3** in a way that 4 popularity in previous time window columns are transformed into 8 columns. The first 4 columns out of 8 new columns are non-zero and contain popularity values if the item's class label is 0. If the class label is 1 then the last 4 columns are non-zero.\n",
