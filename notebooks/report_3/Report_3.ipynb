    "Previously, I've told that I had no success using pure ReLU activation since the input was negative, randomly initialized weights of the NN are in range $ [0, 1] $ making the output also negative. In this case the gradient is always 0, so no weight changing is happening. Since now I negate the input and output pure ReLU should work, but again I've encountered the same problem. In my opinion the reason is that after the first iteration the error is large, which causes the weights to go negative after the first update and after that no training, as in the first case. So I was forced to use Leaky ReLU again. This are the results:"
